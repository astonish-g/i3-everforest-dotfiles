# i3 Everforest Dotfiles

Hello! Welcome to my Everforest dotfiles for i3. This is still a work in progress and I have to clean these dotfiles a little bit. I have just ¨learned¨ how to use Github, so I am trying to upload all of my configs, both for me and for whoever who is interested in using it. :)

I am using this on EndeavourOS, if it makes a difference. 

#### To Dos!
- [ ] Write the needed dependencies.
- [ ] Find and add the oh my bash config file.
- [ ] Find and add the Mozilla config file.
- [x] Export and add Stylus user stylesheets files.

#### Screenshots
Here are some screenshots of the uploaded dotfiles:
