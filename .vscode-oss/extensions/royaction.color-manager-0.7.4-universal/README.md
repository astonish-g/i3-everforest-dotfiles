# Description

- `color picker and color palette (opens in a side-view and adapts to the window-width and your vscode color theme)`
- `works in all languages`
- `supports CSS-Colors, HEX, RGBa and HSLa`
- `AUTO-COMPLETE: insert color-values by meaningful names from vscode's intellisense-widget`
- `no need to select color values (just place the cursor within a color value)`
- `sort and convert options`
- `comes with factory palettes (around 5000 colors)`
- `customizable user-interface`

My main goal was to insert colors by meaningful names. I dont wanna know how many hours i've lost by copying and pasting color values in the past ...

The model of the color picker is different to the one in vscode. It's a recreation from one of the color pickers in Affinity Designer (a nice graphic app i'm using for mockups).

No Node-Modules! The main extension is plain Vanilla JS and has only a few KiloBytes ... it's installed in a few seconds - so check it out!
