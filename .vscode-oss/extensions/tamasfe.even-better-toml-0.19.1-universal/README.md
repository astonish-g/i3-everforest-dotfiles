# Features

## Syntax highlighting

### Additional Syntax Colors

The extension defines custom scopes for array headers and arrays of tables.

In order to differentiate them from regular keys, you can set your own colors for them. Unfortunately this [has to be done manually](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/32813).

You might also want to set a color for dates and times, as they don't have have one in most themes.

```json

  "editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
      "textMateRules": [
          {
              "scope": "support.type.property-name.table",
              "settings": {
                  "foreground": "#4EC9B0",
              },
          },
          {
              "scope": "support.type.property-name.array",
              "settings": {
                  "foreground": "#569CD6",
              }
          },
          {
              "scope": "constant.other.time",
              "settings": {
                  "foreground": "#DCDCAA",
              }
          }
      ]
  },
}
```

## Semantic highlighting

Semantic key highlighting for inline tables and arrays can be enabled in the settings.

**You need to set extended colors in order for this to have any practical effect.**

### Renaming

## Formatting

The formatter is rather conservative by default, additional features can be enabled in the settings. If you're missing a configuration option, feel free to open an issue about it!

## Completion and Validation with [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/)

There is support for completion, hover text, links and validation.

Schemas can be associated with document URIs with the `evenBetterToml.schema.associations` configuration.

You can provide your own schemas or use existing schemas from the [JSON Schema Store](https://www.schemastore.org/json/). More details [here](https://taplo.tamasfe.dev/configuration/using-schemas.html#using-schemas).

## Commands

The extension provides commands for easy JSON<->TOML conversions.

# Configuration File

Taplo CLI's [configuration file](https://taplo.tamasfe.dev/configuration/file) is supported and automatically found in workspace roots, or can be manually set in the VS Code configuration.
